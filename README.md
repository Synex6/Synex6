<h1>Hi, I'm Javier! 

<h2>About me</h2>
I am a recent graduate who has just received their Bachelor's Degree and CompTIA Security+ CE certificate in this May of 2024. I plan on pushing my focus and studies towards a defensive outlook in cybersecurity by working on as many relevant projects as possible along with studying for future certifications such as CompTIA's CYSA+ certification and HackTheBox's HTB Certified Defensive Security Analyst (HTB CDSA) certificate. For the moment, I am currently working on my CCNA and potentially my Splunk Core Certified User certification as well.
Feel free to contact me about anything using the Linkedin logo at the bottom.
